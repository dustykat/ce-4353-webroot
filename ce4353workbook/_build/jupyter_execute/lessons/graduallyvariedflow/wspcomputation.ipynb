    "Two types of methods\n",
    "1. Explicit or direct step method: distance is determined for a specified depth change\n",
    "- Mostly for prismatic channels where cross-sectional properties donâ€™t change with distance x.\n",
    "2. Implicit methods: depth is computed from distance changes\n",
    "- Unknown appears on both sides of the equation dy = f(y)dx\n",
    "- For natural channels for which cross-sectional properties are determined beforehand at particular locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Assumptions**\n",
    "Slope of the energy grade line, $S_f$, can be evaluated from Manning's or Chezy's equation using the local value of depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either method class, there is a slope averaging component to approximate the energy slope at a section especially impotent in natural channels described in our textbook on pg 185\n",

    "In the examples the goal is to illustrate the computational methods employed, averaging the conveyence is just a bit easier programming (not by much). Readers can obviously reverse engineer the scripts and satisfy their own needs.\n",
