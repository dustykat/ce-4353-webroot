# # Rectangular Cross Sections
# 
# The momentum balance can be rearranged to yield the depth ratio:
# 
# $$\frac{y_2}{y_1} = \frac{1}{2} [\sqrt{1 + 8 Fr_1^2} - 1]$$
# 
# Across the jump $E_1 \ne E_2$ and head loss is greater than zero.
# 
# 
# $$h_L = E_1 - E_2 = (y_1+\frac{V_1^2}{2g})-(y_2+\frac{V_2^2}{2g})$$

# ## Other Sections
# 
# There are no simple equations for the depth ratios for non-rectangular shapes, however the $M_1=M_2$ relationship holds, so it is simple enough to use computation methods to find the alternate and sequent depths in any geometry 
# 
# 1. Compute critical depth for the section.
# 2. Alternate depth will be smaller, and Fr larger than 1.
# 3. Sequent depth will be larger, and Fr less than 1.
