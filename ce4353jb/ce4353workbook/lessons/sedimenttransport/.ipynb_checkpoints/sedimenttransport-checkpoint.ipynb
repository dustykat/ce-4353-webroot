    "# Sediment Transport\n",
    "\n",
    "Erosion and the flow of water in rivers and streams continually remove bed load material from the bed and banks of the channel and displace them further downstream. Estimations of this solids load transport is important in river engineering, fluvial geomorphology, ecohydrology, and hazard estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many solids transport (bed load) equations relate metrics such as a characteristic dimension (grain diameter), hydraulic characteristics, and solids density to solids flux. \n",
    "These equations, however, exhibit inadequate estimation performance for a variety of reasons (Recking, 2010). The equations themselves are often the result of regression analysis on variables thought to explain solids flux behavior and are derived from data collected in flume studies and some river studies.\n",
