    "## Backwater Curve\n",
    "The figure below is a backwater curve for a rectangular channel with discharge over a weir (on the right hand side — not depicted).The channel width is 5 meters, bottom slope 0.001, Manning’s n = 0.02 and discharge Q = 55.4m$^3$.\n",

    "Our goal is to replicate the figure using HEC-RAS.\n",

    "## Frontwater Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below is another illustrative case. Here the water discharges into a horizontal channel at a rate of 1 m$^3$ per second per meter width. Assuming Manning’s n = 0.01 we wish\n",

    "We would need to know the critical depth for the section (≈ 0.47meters), then compute the profile moving from the gate downstream (a frontwater curve with respect to the gate).\n",

    "A backwater curve is caused by a weir at the downstream end (to the right in the figure) by a 7 meter tall weir.\n",
    "Flow depth over the weir is at critical depth $h_c = 2.17$ meters.  Normal flow in the upstream portion for 10-meter channel width is $h_n = 5.6$ meters.  Using the fixed space step method determine and plot a profile view of the water surface and channel bottom.\n",
