    "Momentum is a property of moving things and is the product of mass and velocity.  Angular momentum is the similar property in rotating geometries.  It takes an external force to change the momentum of an object.\n",

    "Except at faster than light travel (FTL) when impulse-momentum no longer applies; instead ones survival depends largely on the skill of the scriptwriter.  As engineers we wear the red shirts and are usually sacrificed, although Scottish engineers seem to last many episodes!\n",

    "\n",
    "In the context of hydraulics many phenomenon which cannot be analyzed using the energy equation succumb nicely to momentum. The primary advantage of the momentum equation are that details of internal (to the control volume) flow paqtterns are irrelevant, only the external forces and momentum fluxes need to be considered.  The momentum balance was used earlier to solve the head loss caused by a bridge pier and this is a typical application of momentum balances.\n",

    "Here's a useful sketch.  Supercritical flow upstream meets subcritical downstream.  Downstream controls the flow, $Q$ is same but the downstream velocity os exchanged for flow depth, a bit of energy is lost in the transition.  The jump itself is quite turbulent and has a practical value in chemical mixing as well as energy dissipation.\n",
