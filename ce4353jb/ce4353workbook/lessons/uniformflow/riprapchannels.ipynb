    "They are easily constructed and maintained and work well in a variety of climates and soilconditions. Grass linings provide good erosion protection and can trap sediment and relatedcontaminants in the channel section. Routine maintenance of grass-lined channels consists of mowing, control of weedy plants and woody vegetation, repair of damaged areas and removal of sediment deposits and dead bodies.\n",
    "The behavior of grass in an open channel lining is complicated by the fact that grass stems bend as flow depth and shear stress increase. This reduces the roughness height and increases velocity and flow rate. For some lining materials (bare earth and rigid linings), the roughness height remains constant regardless of the velocity or depth of flow in the channel. As a result, a grass-lined channel cannot be described by a single roughness coefficient.\n",
