# # Gradually Varied Flow (GVF)
# 
# <!--Steady non-uniform flow in comparatively straight, prisimatic channels.  Bottom slope $S_0$ changes from one reach to the next, but is constant within a particular reach.  (i.e. no slope change within a reach)-->
# 
# Steady non-uniform flow in a prismatic channel with gradual changes in its water surface elevation
# 
# For example,
# 
# - backwater produced by a dam or weir across a river
# - drawdown produced at a sudden drop in a channel
# 
# In gradually varied flow (GVF)
# - velocity varies along the channel
# - bed slope, water surface slope, and energy slope will all differ from each other
# 
# :::{note}
# Bottom slope $S_0$ changes from one reach to the next, but is constant within a particular reach.  (i.e. no slope change within a reach).  In practice the slope changes are used to help delineate reaches.
# :::
# 
# Two basic assumptions in GVF analysis
# - Pressure distribution at any section is assumed to be hydrostatic
# - Gradual changes in the surface curvature give rise to negligible normal accelerations
# - Resistance to flow at any depth is assumed to be given by the corresponding uniform flow equation, such as the Manningâ€™s formula with the condition that the slope term to be used in the equation is intended to be the energy slope ($S_f$) and not the bed slope
# 
# $$ S_f = (\frac{Q}{\frac{\alpha}{n}AR^{2/3}})^2$$
# 
# where $\alpha=1$ (SI units) and $\alpha=1.485$ (US customary units).

# ## Differential Equation of the Water Surface
# 
# Recall from our specific energy discussion the various components of the Modified Bernoulli's equation for an open channel
# 
# ![](specificNRG-drawing.png)
# 
# $$ y_1 + \frac{\alpha V_1^2}{2g} + z_1 = y_2 + \frac{\alpha V_2^2}{2g} + z_2 + h_{L;1\rightarrow2}$$
# 
# 

# The total head at  any cross section is (taking $\alpha$ as unity for some visual simplicity)
# 
# $$ H_i = y_i + \frac{V_i^2}{2g} + z_i $$ 
# 
# The slope of the EGL is something like
# 
# $$ -\frac{dH_i}{dx} = \frac{dy_i}{dx} + \frac{d \frac{V_i^2}{2g}}{dx} + \frac{dz_i}{dx} $$ 
# 
# :::{note}
# The minus sign because energy is decreasing in the +x direction
# :::
# 
# Substitute in some geometry to get into a discharge form (which is often more useful!)
# 
# $$ -\frac{dH_i}{dx} = \frac{dy_i}{dx} + \frac{d \frac{Q_i^2}{2gA_i^2}}{dx} + \frac{dz_i}{dx} $$ 
# 
# Now make some observations: the slope of the EGL is the friction slope, and the last term is the channel slope at that location.
# 
# $$ -S_f = \frac{dy_i}{dx} + \frac{d \frac{Q_i^2}{2gA_i^2}}{dx} - S_0 $$ 
# 
# Calculus the ... on the middle term with $Q$
# 
# $$ -S_f = \frac{dy_i}{dx} -2 \frac{Q_i^2}{2gA_i^3}\frac{dA_i}{dy}\frac{dy_i}{dx} - S_0 $$ 
# 
# Recall $\frac{dA_i}{dy}$ is just the topwidth at the section
# 
# $$ -S_f = \frac{dy_i}{dx} -2 \frac{Q_i^2}{2gA_i^3}T_i\frac{dy_i}{dx} - S_0 $$ 
# 
# A wee bit of algebra
# 
# $$ -S_f + S_0 = \frac{dy_i}{dx}(1 -\frac{Q_i^2}{gA_i^3}T_i) $$ 
# 
# Observe the term in parenthesis is $1-Fr_i^2$
# 
# So the expression becomes (dropping the $_i$ subscript
# 
# $$ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{(S_0 - S_f)}{(1 -Fr^2)} $$ 
# 
# And we have an ordinary differential equation of the water surface.  A plot of a particular solution, $y(x)$ is called the water surface profile.  

# ## Classification of Water Surface Profiles
# 
# Process of identification of possible flow profiles as a prelude to quantitative computations
# - As $y \rightarrow y_n$, $\frac{dy}{dx} \rightarrow 0$ , i.e. the water surface approaches the normal depth line asymptotically.
# - As $y \rightarrow y_c$, $\frac{dy}{dx} \rightarrow \infty$, i.e. the water surface meets the critical depth line vertically.
# > High curvatures at critical depth zones violate the assumption of gradually-varied nature of the flow,
# > <br>thus GVF computations have to begin or end a short distance away from the critical-depth location.

# ## Control Sections
# 
# Section in which a fixed (unique?) relationship exists between the discharge and depth of flow.
# 
# - Weirs, spillways sluice gates are some typical examples of structures which give rise to control sections.
# - Critical depth is also a control point.
# - It is effective in a flow profile which changes from subcritical to supercritical flow.  Such 
# 
# Control sections provide a key to the identification of proper profile shapes.
# 
# - Subcritical flows have controls in the downstream end
# - Supercritical flows have controls in the upstream end
# > The direction of computation of subcritical profiles is upstream, and for supercritical, it is downstream.
