# # Water Surface Profile Computation

# ## Background
# 
# Words here
# 
# Two types of methods
# 1. Explicit or direct step method: distance is determined for a specified depth change
# - Mostly for prismatic channels where cross-sectional properties donâ€™t change with distance x.
# 2. Implicit methods: depth is computed from distance changes
# - Unknown appears on both sides of the equation dy = f(y)dx
# - For natural channels for which cross-sectional properties are determined beforehand at particular locations.
# 
# **Important Assumptions**
# Slope of the energy grade line, $S_f$, can be evaluated from Manning's or Chezy's equation using the local value of depth.
# 
# In either method class, there is a slope averaging component to approximate the energy slope at a section especially impotent in natural channels described in our textbook on pg 185

# In the scripts in this JupyterBook, the average conveyence is used in the direct step and fixed space step method examples.

# :::{note}
# In the examples the goal is to illustrate the computational methods employed, averaging the conveyence is just a bit easier programming (not by much). Readers can obviously reverse engineer the scripts and satisfy their own needs.
