# # Stilling Basins
# 
# Used to create/fix a hydraulic jump in a known location to dissipate energy and prevent damage from super-duper-critical flow. 
#

# 
# 
# 
# The idea is to increase the apparent (to the water) channel roughness 
# Momentum is used to deduce drag force imparted by the basin, and per-block projected area is combined into a total projected area for force approximation.

# The stilling basin itself includes the apron and the blocks and sill
