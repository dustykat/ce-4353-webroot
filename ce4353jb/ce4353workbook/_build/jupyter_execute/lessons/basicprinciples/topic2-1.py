# # Solution of Open Channel Problems
# 
# Solutions to problems are achieved by a combination of
# 
# - Fluid Mechanics: conservation of mass, momentum, and energy
# - Empirical and theoretical equations & [nomographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) (graphical calculators).   These are espeically common in 1-D steady flow applications.
# - Computational hydraulics.  Complex geometries, unsteady flow.  
#   1. 1-D steady/unsteady is routine 
#   2. 2-D steady/unsteady is state-of-practice
#   3. 3-D steady is state-of-art
#   4. 3-D unsteady is research (for now; but just wait a few years as technology advances)
