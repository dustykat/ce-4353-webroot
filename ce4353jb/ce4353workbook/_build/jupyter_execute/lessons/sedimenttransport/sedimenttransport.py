# # Sediment Transport
# 
# Erosion and the flow of water in rivers and streams continually remove bed load material from the bed and banks of the channel and displace them further downstream. Estimations of this solids load transport is important in river engineering, fluvial geomorphology, ecohydrology, and hazard estimation. 
# 
# Many solids transport (bed load) equations relate metrics such as a characteristic dimension (grain diameter), hydraulic characteristics, and solids density to solids flux. 
# These equations, however, exhibit inadequate estimation performance for a variety of reasons (Recking, 2010). The equations themselves are often the result of regression analysis on variables thought to explain solids flux behavior and are derived from data collected in flume studies and some river studies.

# ## What is Sediment?
# - Matter that settles to the bottom of a liquid
#  - May be particles that are derived from rocks, biological materials, or chemical precipitates 
#  - Storm water sediments typically are a mix of materials, including pavement dust, natural soils, vehicle rust particles, tire dust particles, oils, pesticides, fertilizer
# - Transported by water or wind

# ## Bed Material Transport
# - Stream bed load is part of total sediment load that moves along bottom of channel
# - Sediment particles roll, bounce, or slide along bottom
# - When stream has ability to re-suspend, some of particles will move
# - When it loses ability to carry particles in suspension, they will drop out again
# - Depends on local stream velocity and settling velocity of individual particles
