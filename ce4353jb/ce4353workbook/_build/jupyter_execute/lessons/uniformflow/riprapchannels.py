# # Rip-Rap Lined Channels
# 
# Rip-rap lined channels refers to engineered channels with a flexible lining in distinct contrast with a rigid lined channel (i.e. concrete).

# Riprap (in North American English), also known as rip rap, rip-rap, shot rock, rock armour (in British English) or rubble, is human-placed rock or other material used to protect shoreline structures against scour and water, wave, or ice erosion. Ripraps are used to armor shorelines, streambeds, bridge abutments, foundational infrastructure supports and other shoreline structures against erosion.
