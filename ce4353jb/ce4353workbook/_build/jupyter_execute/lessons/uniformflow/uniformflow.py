# # Uniform Flow
# 
# Uniform flow occurs when the average velocities in successive cross sections of a channel are the same. This occurs only when the cross section is constant. Non-uniform flow results from gradual or sudden changes in the cross sectional area.
# If the water surface is parallel to the channel bottom, flow is uniform and the water surface is at normal depth $y_n$
# 
# Used for design of long open channels with the goal to have the water surface slope equal to the bed slope.  Heres a couple of pictures,

# First a Central Aridzona Project canal

# And the Central Valley Project (Callyfornia) canal I grew up swimmin' in.

# The line of floaty balls means you are approaching one of these:

# Even though swimmin' in the canals is illegal, the operators dont want to turn a bunch of kids into fish food, so they put up the balls.

# Despite the obvious Darwinian advantage of grinding up kids - dead meat does not pay taxes; support old folks; nor serve as a supply of harvestable kidneys.  Hence we try to save them.
